##Designed a basic 4Ã—8 synchronous RAM using Verilog HDL as part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD. The RAM supports read and write operations controlled by a clock and write-enable signal. A Verilog testbench was developed to verify functionality using simulation tools like ModelSim/Vivado. The project includes Verilog code, simulation results, and a detailed PDF report. This task improved my understanding of memory design, sequential circuits, and VLSI design flow.
